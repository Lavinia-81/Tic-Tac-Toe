# Tic-Tac-Toe
https://lavinia-81.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game repository! This project contains the code for a classic Tic Tac Toe game, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game board and elements.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Adds the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with 9 cells.
3. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their marks (X or O).
4. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Key Concepts

- **Game Logic**: Implemented in JavaScript to handle player turns, check for wins or draws, and update the game state.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game looks great on all devices.
- **Event Handling**: Uses JavaScript to add events to elements for a dynamic user experience.
